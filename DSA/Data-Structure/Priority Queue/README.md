# Priority Queue

## when and where is a PD used?

- Used in certain implementations of Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm.
- Dynamically fetch the next best or next worst element.
- Huffman coding.
- Best First Search (BFS) algorithms.
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms.

## Complexity PQ with binary heap

- Binary Heap construction: O(n)
- Polling: O(log(n))
- Peeking: O(1)
- Adding: O(log(n))
