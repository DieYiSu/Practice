# Practice code repo
Hi, I'm David.
This repo include all my practice records.

I will explain some point in every side-project:
- What new technology did I use?
- What new tool did I use?
- What problem did I face?
- How did I solve the problem?

## Why I do this?

Because I want to learn more systematic, and I like the feeling when I learn the new tech and tool.

Every time I use these techs and tools in my new side-project, I feel I'm stronger in tech development.

## Any skill tree (learning roadMap) you recommend?

Yes, you can search google by typing the keyword, just like - **frontend skill tree** or **frontend roadmap**,there have lots of resources to make your learning more systematic.

Take myself for example, I'm learning the frontend currently, so I search the frontend skill tree, and I found this one.

you can easily find what resource you need on this roadmap :)
