I will explain some point in every side-project:
- What new technology did I use?
- What new tool did I use?
- What problem did I face?
- How did I solve the problem?
## Why I do this?
Because I want to learn more systematic, and I like the feeling when I learn the new tech and tool.
Every time I use these techs and tools in my new side-project, I feel I'm stronger in tech development.
## Any skill tree (learning roadMap) you recommend?
Yes, you can search google by typing the keyword, just like - **frontend skill tree** or **frontend roadmap**,there have lots of resources to make your learning more systematic.
Take myself for example, I'm learning the frontend currently, so I search the frontend skill tree, and I found this one.

you can easily find what resource you need on this roadmap :)

# Side-Project
## JavaScript
This project target is to make a BMI calculator.
### New Tech? 
- Vanilla.js, which means you can't any third-party js library, like jQuery!
- Airbnb JavaScript Coding Style.
- SCSS OOCSS.
### New Tools?
- ESLint, I used the wesbos setting, which makes you easily to build your eslint setting (https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos)
- Prettier, a tool can auto-format your code.
### Problem ?
Have to think more coding way when you don't use jQuery. 
### How to solve the problem?
You can use the querySelector in your vanilla.js code, instead of using jQuery
```js
//Bad, jQuery
$('a')

//Good, Vanilla.js
const a  = document.querySelector('.a');
```
## RWD
## jQuery
## HTML & CSS
